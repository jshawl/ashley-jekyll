<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adip* isicing elit, sed do eiusmod&nbsp;* tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna&nbsp;aliqua.</p>

<p>Mad props to <a href="http://trentwalton.com/2012/06/19/fluid-type/">Trent Walton</a> for that.</p>

<p>Also, gotta see what <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italics</em> and lists look like.</p>

<ul>
	<li><span>This is what you call</span></li>
	<li><span>What I like to call</span></li>
	<li><span>What she said</span></li>
	<li><span>An unordered list</span></li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li><span>This, however</span></li>
	<li><span>How mathematical</span></li>
	<li><span>Mathematical!</span></li>
	<li><span>So many numbers!</span></li>
	<li><span>I’m running out of fingers</span></li>
</ol>

<p>And a paragraph following. Oh oh, blockquotes!</p>

<blockquote>
Someone said something once, and it was quoted – though I’m not really sure it was worth quoting, but then he decided to get really meta and:
<blockquote>Quote within a quote. How does that make sense?</blockquote>
